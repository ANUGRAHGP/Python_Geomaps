Kerala Tourism Data Analysis

This repository contains a data-driven analysis of Kerala Tourism Statistics, exploring trends in Domestic Tourist Visits (DTV) and Foreign Tourist Visits (FTV) across districts of Kerala. The project highlights the impact of COVID-19 on tourism, district-level variations, and actionable recommendations for sustainable tourism growth.

📊 Key Insights

🦠 Both DTV & FTV declined sharply during COVID.

📈 DTV has surpassed pre-COVID levels post-pandemic.

🌍 FTV is on a steady rise but hasn’t fully recovered yet.

🌏 Domestic tourists mostly from Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka.

✈️ Top foreign arrivals from US & UK.

🏆 Top 3 DTV districts: Ernakulam, Idukki, Thiruvananthapuram.

⬇️ Bottom 3 DTV districts: Kollam, Pathanamthitta, Kasaragod.

🏆 Top 3 FTV districts: Ernakulam, Thiruvananthapuram, Idukki.

⬇️ Bottom 3 FTV districts: Kasaragod, Palakkad, Pathanamthitta.

💰 Though only 3% of tourists are foreign, they contribute 12% of total tourism revenue.

🚆✈️ Districts with better rail & air connectivity have higher tourist footfall.
